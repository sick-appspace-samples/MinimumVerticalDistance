  Application Name:  
  MinimumVerticalDistance                                                                                                                       
                                                                                      
  Summary:
  Searching segments of scan from file for minimum vertical distance.  
  
  Description:
  This sample acquires scans and searches a segment of that scan for a minimum 
  vertical distance assuming the scanner looks downwards vertically.
  The minimum distance found is printed to the console and sent via TCP/IP.
  The scan viewer will also show the scans to verify the result.
  
  How to run:
  Starting this sample is possible either by running the app (F5) or 
  debugging (F7+F10). Output is printed to the console and the transformed 
  point cloud can be seen on the viewer in the web page. The playback stops 
  after the last scan in the file. To replay, the sample must be restarted.
  To run this sample, a device with AppEngine >= 2.5.0 is required.
  
  Implementation: 
  To run with real device data, the file provider has to be exchanged with the 
  appropriate scan provider.
  To transmit data via TCPIP, the IP address and port have to be adapted- 
  To disabled view set MAKE_VIEW = false.
